# ProjectCOD - Project Status: Active
Welcome to my Tek Systems/ Optum Case Study
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Inspiration for this project:
I volunteer at my local church's cafe and during church on Sundays, the line for coffee gets pretty long.
Many people drink the same thing each week, but there are also many who are not sure what drinks are available
or whatâ€™s in them. We do not have enough menu board space to list out the ingredients and description of each drink.
In addition to that, we usually have specialty drinks each month, to match the season, and it is not easy for the
customer to see those until they reach the cash register. We would like a place for the customer to go where they can see their
options before they reach the cash register.

                                My Story
This is my first foray into programming. I thought I had an idea of what the bootcamp would be like, but honestly it was nothing like my previous learning experiences. The first few weeks were a struggle. My off hours were filled with studying, trying to keep up with all the new subjects. In week three I even reached out to Young and Colleen to make sure I was using all of the available resources. Even though I felt like I was at a disadvantage, having not completed a previous programming course, I knew I had earned the right to be here and would try my hardest. Each week seemed more challenging than the week before, until I realized that every new topic was helping me understand the previous one. Something I couldn't follow just a couple weeks before all of a sudden made sense. Around week five the tutoring sessions began and I attended them faithfully. Each day Lawrence and Bably reinforced the day's lesson and continued to help me connect the dots. These sessions were invaluable, because it allowed me to slow the pace down and better grasp each class. All in all the past 11 weeks have pushed and pulled me more than any other experience and I appreciate the growth that I have gained.

                              User Stories
1. As a customer I would like to be able send feedback to the cafe manager and make fun suggestions for monthly drink specials
2. As an employee I want customers to know what drinks are available before they get to the counter. This will help move the line faster between services.
3. As an admin I want the app to match the church's color scheme, so everything flows together
4. As an admin I would like to collect customer/member data, so we can send out promotions and advertise the cafe
5. As an admin I want to be able to target loyal cafe customers with coupons, to reward them for their frequent patronage.
6. As an admin I want to be able to easily showcase the monthly drink specials, because we have customers who really look forward to them

                            Challenges Faced
 1. Solidified my JAVASCRIPT, JAVA, HTML & CSS syntax.
 2. I was able to fix a bug where using email as the primary key was not the best approach. After doing some research I found the better approach was to use an auto generated int as a primary key.
 3.  Database Relationship/ Connectivity. I had trouble creating the connections between tables and reached out to my classmates for help and Carlos reached back and  graphically explained how to set up the connectivity. 
 4.  Displaying items in the front end. I was having problems with displaying my item images. I did some research and reached out to the instructional team and got the solution to use image urls and display them using jsp
