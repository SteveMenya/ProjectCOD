# ProjectCOD

Welcome to my Tek Systems/ Optum Case Study. Also Known as project Coffee On Demand.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Inspiration for this project:
I volunteer at my local church's cafe and during church on Sundays, the line for coffee gets pretty long.
Many people drink the same thing each week, but there are also many who are not sure what drinks are available
or whatâ€™s in them. We do not have enough menu board space to list out the ingredients and description of each drink.
In addition to that, we usually have specialty drinks each month, to match the season, and it is not easy for the
customer to see those until they reach the cash register. We would like a place for the customer to go where they can see their
options before they reach the cash register.
